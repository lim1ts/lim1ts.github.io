Hello!
This is my first github pages post, a test post, mostly.

{% highlight ruby %}
def sayHello()
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
sayHello('Everyone')
{% endhighlight %}

I'm a computer science undergraduate studying in NUS with an interest in networks and security. This is where I log the various things I've learnt that I find interesting and isn't exactly tied down to my work or school.
I try to post once a week, to basically log the stuff that I've done or have learnt to make revision easier. 

Check out my [github repo][repo] too.
There isn't much there since most of the stuff I do is school work - but hopefully that's going to change sometime soon.
