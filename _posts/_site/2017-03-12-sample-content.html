<p>Hello!
This is my first github pages post, a test post, mostly.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sayHello</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">sayHello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Everyone'</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’m a computer science undergraduate studying in NUS with an interest in networks and security. This is where I log the various things I’ve learnt that I find interesting and isn’t exactly tied down to my work or school.
I try to post once a week, to basically log the stuff that I’ve done or have learnt to make revision easier.</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/lim1ts">github repo</a> too.
There isn’t much there since most of the stuff I do is school work - but hopefully that’s going to change sometime soon.</p>
